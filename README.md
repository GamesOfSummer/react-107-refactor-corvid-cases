# For Later or Things Missed
* [ ] strip out google maps - not in the mood to be bothered about public key complains on Github
* [ ] - Error Boundaries
* [ ] - add sliding animation 
* [ ] - find a good font - the font requested (Avernir Next) is a paid font, so I opted to not use it. 
* [ ] - fix `variable as any` if possible
* [ ] - look into react hooks - as the coupling is weird

* [ ] - Install Redux for state management 
* [ ] - Get that current restaurant in state
* [ ] - Install mocha / chai / Sinon / 
* [ ] - test that state
* [ ] - add formatters, unit test formatters
